# Luminosus (ETC Eos Edition) - MIDI to OSC Tool

Luminosus (ETC Eos Edition) is the project title for a "companion app" for consoles of the ETC Eos family. At the moment it can convert MIDI Note, Program and Control Change Messages to OSC commands. The goal is to eventually show useful information about Channel Attributes and Cue Lists and provide functions missing in the Eos software (i.e. a random fire effect).
It is designed for touch interaction and runs on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS.

## Project State

This project is in __pre-alpha__ / proof-of-concept state.
A more complete version will be released __end of September__.
